# Requirements for Pangea Python Interpreter Testing Suite
# 
# Core testing dependencies for stress testing, performance benchmarking,
# and production readiness validation

# System monitoring for performance testing
psutil>=5.8.0

# Statistical analysis for benchmarking
matplotlib>=3.5.0  # For performance visualization (optional)
numpy>=1.21.0      # For advanced statistical analysis (optional)

# Standard library modules used:
# - threading (built-in)
# - concurrent.futures (built-in)
# - time (built-in)
# - statistics (built-in) 
# - json (built-in)
# - subprocess (built-in)
# - queue (built-in)
# - ast (built-in)
# - gc (built-in)
# - traceback (built-in)
# - pathlib (built-in)

# Note: The core Pangea interpreter has no external dependencies
# These requirements are only for the comprehensive testing suite
